[Simulated Threat: Port Scan on Local Network]

Goal: Simulate suspicious behavior to trigger GlassWire alerts.

Tools Used:
- Angry IP Scanner (https://angryip.org/)

Steps:
1. Connect a second device to the same Wi-Fi network.
2. Install Angry IP Scanner on that device.
3. Run a scan on the subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254).
4. On the main device running GlassWire:
   - Observe the “Things” and “Alerts” tabs.
   - Note any new devices or IP activity.

Outcome:
GlassWire detected the new device and displayed an alert with the MAC address and hostname.
